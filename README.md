In this project, I have been focused on creating a RESTful medical application, which involves managing patient, doctor, and appointment data, along with implementing identity management.
My aim has been gaining a practical understanding of web service design.
This has enhanced my skills in developing sophisticated, service-oriented software solutions, particularly in a healthcare setting.
